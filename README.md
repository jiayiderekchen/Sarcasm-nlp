# Sarcasm-nlp
Sarcasm detection has received considerable attention in the NLP community in recent years (Joshi, 2016). Computational approaches for sarcasm detection have modeled either the utterance in isolation or together with contextual information such as conversation context, author context, visual context, or cognitive features. This current shared task aims to study the role of conversation context for sarcasm detection (Ghosh et al., 2018).

We will be using two different datasets: Twitter conversations and conversation threads from Reddit. For both datasets, we will provide the immediate context (i.e., only the previous dialogue turn) as well as the full dialogue thread, when available. The goal is to understand how much conversation context is needed or helpful for sarcasm detection.

The computational models proposed by Ghosh et al. (2018), already released as open-source, will be used as a baseline. Sarcasm data is collected from Twitter using the standard hashtags of #sarcasm and #sarcastic. The Reddit data for training will be a subset of the datasets introduced by Khodak et al. (2017).
